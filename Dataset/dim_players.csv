0,Rohit Sharma,"Languid and easy on the eye, Rohit Sharma owned all the shots in the book when he emerged from the Mumbai suburbs as heir apparent to the Indian batting greats of the 2000s. It took him time and persistence, but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20.",India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/385800/385819.2.png"
1,Virat Kohli,"India has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them.",India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Top order Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316605.3.png"

3,Suryakumar Yadav,"Hard-hitting 360-degree batter Suryakumar Yadav has all the shots, including a few not in any textbook save the one written by AB de Villiers. He also has a yen for making batting look easy, as he showed during four golden years with Mumbai Indians starting in 2018, during which they won the IPL title twice, thanks in no small part to his 1700-plus runs at a strike rate of around 140.",India,Right hand Bat,"Right arm Medium, Right arm Offbreak",Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/331100/331163.1.png"
4,Axar Patel,"Left-arm spinner Axar Patel has been increasingly handy with the bat in the lower order across formats - enough to be classified as a bowling allrounder. He played just one first-class game in his debut season for Gujarat, but had a more successful showing in 2013, when he was one of the key contributors to India Under-23s' title win in the ACC Emerging Teams Cup, with seven wickets, including a four-for in the semi-final against UAE. He was consistent for Gujarat with bat and ball in the Ranji Trophy that season, finishing with 369 runs at an average of 46.12 and 29 wickets at 23.58.",India,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/331100/331164.2.png"
5,Shivam Dube,"Within his first year of white-ball debut in domestic cricket, Dube had started hitting boundaries in the lower order and picking wickets. His Ranji Trophy debut also put him in the spotlight when he bagged a five-for to dismiss five of Karnataka's top six batters, combined with a brisk 71 down the order. But the headline moment came when he smashed five sixes in an over off Pravin Tambe in a Mumbai T20 league game and repeated the feat in a Ranji match against Baroda, just a day before the IPL auction in December 2018. That season, Dube had also taken a seven-for against Karnataka and struck his maiden first-class century. Those shot his value up so much that RCB splurged Rs 5 crore for him. However, he couldn't prove to be the finisher RCB wanted him to be for two seasons and he switched to Rajasthan Royals for the 2020 season.",India,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383700/383773.1.png"

8,Reeza Hendricks,"Hendricks made his international debut in a T20I series against Australia in 2014, where he made 49 in the third match.

9,Quinton de Kock,"Quinton de Kock's fearless striking and handy glovework earned him comparisons to greats of the game like Adam Gilchrist and Mark Boucher early in his career. By 21, he shared the record for the most successive ODI centuries - three - before it was bettered by Kumar Sangakkara. A year later, he had established himself in all three formats for South Africa.",South Africa,Left hand Bat,N/A,Wicketkeeper Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316668.1.png"
10,Aiden Markram,"He did well against tougher opposition as well, making 94 in a comprehensive win over India in Centurion in January 2018 and two big hundreds against Australia in the contentious Sandpapergate series two months later. But overseas success took a while to come - after disappointing tours of India and Sri Lanka, Markram made his first away Test hundred in a second-innings effort in Rawalpindi in February 2021, showing he had the technique to navigate pitches that turned and stayed low. His 108 gave South Africa a fighting chance, but they eventually lost the series 2-0.",South Africa,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322000/322067.1.png"
11,Tristan Stubbs,"Schooled at Grey High School in Gqeberha, Stubbs was the captain of the first team. He was also the leading run-scorer at the 2018 Khaya Majola Cricket week, an Under-19 tournament in South Africa, and was selected for the SA Schools side. Stubbs did not make the South Africa Under-19 squad, but was instead selected to make his provincial debut for Eastern Province in January 2020.",South Africa,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/348500/348577.1.png"
12,Heinrich Klaasen,"Schooled at Menlopark High School and the University of Pretoria, Klaasen made his first-class debut for Northerns in the 2012-13 season and averaged 42.58 in the provincial three-day cup. He scored his first franchise hundred in February 2017: 195 to help Titans beat Dolphins in the penultimate round of the first-class competition.",South Africa,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322000/322073.1.png"
13,David Miller,"A hard-hitting left-hander with a penchant for clearing the boundary, David Miller made famous the phrase ""If it's in the arc, it's out the park."" Miller is a self-styled finisher who is strong off the front and back foot and eager to swing his arms, as well as a gun fielder.",South Africa,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316655.1.png"
14,Marco Jansen,"Jansen went on to tour India with South Africa's Under-19 side in 2019 and, that season, was the leading wicket-taker for North West in the three-day provincial competition. He travelled with South Africa's Test squad to Pakistan in early 2021 and was signed by Mumbai Indians for the IPL. Jansen made his Test debut against India in the Boxing Day Test in 2021, and became the first player born in the 2000s to be capped for the national side.Firdose Moonda",South Africa,Right hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Bowling Allrounder,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/337100/337189.1.png"
15,Keshav Maharaj,"In his youth, Maharaj was a pace bowler, whose father played for Natal B during segregation years. He turned to spin on a whim in the nets one afternoon at school. He found that it worked and stuck to it. Maharaj's secret was his accuracy. At the Dolphins, he was able to combine that with an ability to take wickets at key moments.",South Africa,Right hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322000/322072.1.png"
16,Kagiso Rabada,"A strapping, genuine quick who regularly bowls in the 140-150kph range, Kagiso Rabada is the most exciting talent to emerge from South Africa in the post No.1 Test ranking era. Before he had turned 21, Rabada had already established himself as a potential leader of the attack.",South Africa,Left hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/320300/320376.1.png"

18,Tabraiz Shamsi,"Shamsi bounced between the Highveld and Kwa-Zulu Natal and pushed for a place at franchise level after a strong 2013-14 season for Easterns. He took 47 wickets at 20.02 to finish third in the three-day cup wicket-takers' list, and then played five matches in the 2014-15 franchise 20-over competition where caught the eye of the touring West Indians, who were visiting South Africa that summer.",South Africa,Right hand Bat,Left arm Wrist spin,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322000/322068.1.png"
19,Arshdeep Singh,"Arshdeep is one of only three Indian bowlers, after Jhulan Goswami and Ajit Agarkar, to start his T20I career with a maiden over. A death-overs specialist known for his accurate yorkers and 140kph-plus deliveries, he made his international debut in England in 2022.",India,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/390700/390798.5.png"
20,Jasprit Bumrah,"Jasprit Bumrah grabbed eyeballs first with his unorthodox action, and then his bowling skills. Armed with an anomalous, sling-arm action and natural pace, the peculiar release point of Bumrah's deliveries makes it hard for batsmen to pick him.",India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319900/319940.2.png"
21,Kuldeep Yadav,"Kuldeep Yadav started as a fast bowler when he first joined a cricket academy in Kanpur, but was asked by his coach Kapil Pandey to switch to something much rarer - left-arm wristspin. The change wasn't smooth - Kuldeep admitted that he had even tried once - but he soon realised bowling left-arm wristspin was the way forward for him. And he was good at it too, having not only solid control over the length, but also a potent wrong'un among his variations.",India,Left hand Bat,Left arm Wrist spin,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319900/319943.2.png"
22,Phil Salt,"Born in Wales but raised in Barbados, Salt's interests quickly switched from football to cricket. He had watched Manchester City home and away growing up, but the move to the Caribbean inspired a desire to play cricket, and play it aggressively. He won a scholarship to play cricket at Reed School in Surrey, from where he was recommended to Keith Medlycott and joined their academy. He made a first-team debut in August 2015, but it wasn't until 2018 that he really broke through.",England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383141.1.png"
23,Jos Buttler,"England have had many players down the ages who have gained world acclaim, but Jos Buttler is arguably their first global Twenty20 superstar. Buttler helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary as they turned a group-stage exit in the 2015 World Cup into a triumph on home soil four years later, with his efforts with the bat and the gloves crucial to their Super-Over victory in the final. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai. He has also shone at the IPL, and quickly became a senior player in the Test side since his surprise recall in 2018.",England,Right hand Bat,N/A,Wicketkeeper Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383143.1.png"
24,Moeen Ali,"While many critics dismissed him as a ""part-time"" bowler, Moeen had a record to compare with the best in county cricket over recent seasons. And while he suffered more than his share of ups and downs, for the next five years he manfully carried the load in one of the most under-resourced areas of the English game. When he was dropped during the 2019 Ashes, subsequently losing his central contract, it turned out to be the beginning of the end for Moeen as a Test allrounder; nevertheless, on calling time in 2021, he finished just shy of 3000 Test runs and 200 wickets, making him England's third most-prolific spinner of all time.",England,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383142.1.png"
25,Jonny Bairstow,"Jonny Bairstow, the son of the former England wicketkeeper David Bairstow, is a combative wicketkeeper-batter who has become a cricketer to be reckoned with in England's middle order. The journey was far from easy for Bairstow, especially with Jos Buttler in contention for the gloves, but prolific run-making for Yorkshire eventually made a case that England's selectors could not ignore. Galvanised by his selection, runs flowed.",England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383157.1.png"
26,Harry Brook,"By then, Brook was also a T20 World Cup winner, after featuring in England's triumph in Australia earlier in the winter, and at the IPL auction in December, he was snapped up by Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs 13.25 crore (£1.3 million).",England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383145.1.png"
27,Sam Curran,"Perhaps the only real conclusion to that debate is it does not matter. Curran has developed into an X-factor cricketer of global repute. He was player of the T20 World Cup in 2022, taking 13 wickets at 11.38, with an economy rate of 6.52, emerging as a canny death bowler to take England to glory. He signed off with a player of the match performance in the final against Pakistan, taking 3 for 12.",England,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383153.1.png"
28,Liam Livingstone,"Livingstone first attracted attention when he creamed 350 in 138 balls for club side Nantwich in 2015 - one of the largest individual scores in any officially sanctioned limited-overs game.  He won a trophy that season when Lancashire took the NatWest Blast title, though he himself didn't do much of note (and needed stitches after he was attacked in a bar earlier during in the competition).",England,Right hand Bat,"Right arm Offbreak, Legbreak",Batting Allrounder,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383152.1.png"
29,Chris Jordan,"Jordan's career looked to be going nowhere at the end of 2012 when he was released by Surrey, but he made his international debut less than a year later. He enjoyed a run in England's white-ball sides in the games following the 2013-14 Ashes tour, and was given a Test debut the following summer.",England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383144.1.png"
30,Jofra Archer,"A silky fast bowler and dangerous lower-order hitter from Barbados, Archer is capable of hair-raising speeds. He played for West Indies Under-19s in 2013, but soon declared his intention to play for England when he moved to the country, taking advantage of his British passport (thanks to his English father). He broke into Sussex's first-class side in 2016, when he made his debut in all three formats and took 35 wickets in all, 23 of them at 30 runs apiece in Division Two; he also struck 72 in his debut match from No. 8 against Essex. The following season fetched him a bumper crop of Championship wickets - 61 at a little over 25 each in Sussex's fourth-place finish on the table - and an average of over 45 with the bat.",England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383146.1.png"
31,Adil Rashid,"His success in the limited-overs game owed much to his variation - and his wicked googly in particular - and it was no great surprise when he got his Test debut in 2015 against Pakistan. Rashid took 60 wickets in 19 Tests, but often struggled for control and a long-standing shoulder complaint meant his focus returned to the shorter formats after the 2019 tour of the Caribbean.",England,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383151.1.png"
32,Reece Topley,"That four years on Topley is regarded as a vital part of England's white ball plans, as a left-armer who deliveries from a great height, speaks of his mental fortitude. In 2022, he grew in both white ball codes at international level, registering the best ODI figures for an Englishman with 6 for 34 against India at Lord's. A sucker-punch came on the eve of that year's T20 World Cup when he rolled his left ankle, rupturing the ligaments, after stepping on a boundary sponge during a fielding drill ahead of England's final warm-up match. He was subsequently ruled out of the tournament.",England,Right hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383100/383150.1.png"

34,Ibrahim Zadran,"Zadran, a veteran of two Under-19 World Cups in which he was his side's top run-scorer, got off to a storming start in senior international cricket: he made three hundreds in five ODIs when he came back to the format following a two-year hiatus after his first match, in 2019. The last of those centuries was 162 against Sri Lanka in Pallekele, which won him the Player-of-the-Series award.",Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Opening Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/383200/383225.1.png"
35,Gulbadin Naib,"But Naib was dropped soon after, and had to deal with hardship in his personal life: his father was unemployed, his mother had hepatitis, and the family was struggling to deal with the needs of his disabled sister. Happily, Naib was able to force his way back into the national team in 2011 and settled into a floating role in Afghanistan's middle order, chipping in with both bat and ball. His maiden international fifty contributed to Afghanistan's first T20I series win over a Full Member, against Zimbabwe in October 2015. A few months later, he scored his first ODI fifty in a series win against the same opposition, to help Afghanistan break into the top ten in the ODI rankings. His biggest test came when he was promoted to captain the side for the 2019 World Cup; unfortunately Afghanistan failed to win a single game in the tournament.",Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Batting Allrounder,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/381900/381925.2.png"

37,Mohammad Nabi,"Nabi took up cricket at the age of 10 while living in Peshawar. Honing his skills with endless sessions of tennis-ball cricket, he managed to begin training at Arshad Khan's academy in Peshawar and made his competitive debut against Rahim Yar Khan Cricket Association in Pakistan's erstwhile Cornelius Trophy in 2003, making 61 after having just met most of his team-mates. On a tour of India he caught Mike Gatting's eye with a century against a visiting MCC side. That brought him more valuable experience with MCC, for whom he made his first-class debut, and he went on to play a major role in Afghanistan's progress to the World Cup Qualifiers in South Africa in 2009. Nabi struck 58 against Scotland on one-day international debut and 102 in his first first-class game for Afghanistan, against a Zimbabwe XI.",Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/381900/381920.2.png"

40,Rashid Khan,"Rashid Khan has been Afghanistan's first global superstar, and the key to their successes in their early years in international cricket.

41,Noor Ahmad,"After making his first-class debut in 2019 at the age of 14, Noor was only 15 when he landed a contract with Melbourne Renegades, making him the youngest player in BBL history. A Pakistan Super League gig with Karachi Kings followed in 2021, and then came a maiden call-up to the Afghanistan team.

Litton was picked in Bangladesh's Under-19 side in 2012, the year after he made his first-class debut, and over two U-19 World Cups, that year and in 2014, he cumulatively averaged over 50, with a century and three fifties.",Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319700/319727.1.png"

He showed vulnerability driving through the off-side, particularly against high-quality fast bowling. Tanzid's only fifty was against India in Pune when he shelved his doubts, using his limited strokes to good effect.

46,Najmul Hossain Shanto,"The turnaround in his form came at the 2022 T20 World Cup. He began the tournament uncertain of his place in the XI but finished it as his side's leading run-getter. The clarity in his mind and his shot-making was evident as he turned 2023 into a bumper year, becoming Bangladesh's top run-scorer in every format. He scored 1650 international runs at an average of 42.30 that year, versus 1603 runs at 22.90 between 2017 and 2023.

He pulled off that feat again in 2017 against Pakistan in Roseau, where he made an unbeaten 101, exactly half of his team's total in the innings, but they failed to chase down a tough 304.

His 24 first-class wickets that season and the World Cup performance saw him fast-tracked into the Test side; he debuted against India at Gros Islet in August 2016 and bounced out Virat Kohli for 3 for his first wicket.

Though New Zealand had a poor tour of England in 2022, losing all three Tests, Mitchell came out of the summer glowing, with two fifties and three hundreds, including a massive one at Trent Bridge.

Despite that, he became a force in the domestic first-class game. For Northern Districts in the seven Plunket Shield seasons starting in 2012-13, his mastery of turn and flight fetched him 181 wickets.

124,Dhananjaya de Silva,"An eye-catching domestic season in 2016 got him a Test call-up, and he showed his potential with a hundred and a half-century against Australia in his third Test. He also scored match-winning hundreds in Harare, and at home against West Indies and Pakistan, the latter two scores coming in the second innings, but more often than not, de Silva was playing with his back to the wall, in the midst of a collapse, like the hundred to save the Delhi Test in 2017 and 46 and 47 not out to help Sri Lanka survive longer in Christchurch in 2023. In the next Test in Wellington, he made 98 in the follow-on. What makes him even more valuable is his ability to chip in with part-time offspin and his reliable fielding in the slips.

He took 3 for 16 on a Pune greentop, against India, having only taken two domestic T20 wickets before then.

Though he began his senior team career exclusively as a batter - he bowled just once in his first 22 T20Is and similarly in just a handful of ODIs while captained by Khadka - his disciplined offspin became a staple of the team's strategy when Nepal's fixtures resumed following the Covid pandemic.

He played for Ireland in the World Twenty20 in England in 2009, and then signed a three-year contract with Middlesex in December 2009. The following year he gave further notice of his talent by thumping a 134-ball 177 for Ireland against Canada in Toronto - the highest ODI score made by an Irishman. While he struggled in the 2011 World Cup, he ended the tournament with 101 in Ireland's victory against the Netherlands, and a century in Ireland's ODI series against Pakistan in May 2011 had Waqar Younis purring. He added another against the same opponents in Ireland's tie with Pakistan two years later.

He made a bright start against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, averaging nearly 60 with the bat in his first eight innings, but against more challenging opposition, his deficiencies were quickly exposed. A lengthy lean patch followed, and once he lost his place to Sarfaraz for the World T20 in 2016, there was little doubt who Pakistan's No. 1 wicketkeeper was. After the debacle at the World T20, Sarfaraz was appointed captain of the limited-overs sides, and consequently Rizwan's game time diminished further, coming to a complete halt until Sarfaraz sat out the last five games on the tour to South Africa in January 2019 serving a ban.",Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_320,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/320400/320458.1.png"

It earned him a brief Bangladesh Premier League gig, as well as a second chance at the PSL, one he grasped with both hands. With Peshawar Zalmi, he finished among the highest run-scorers in 2023 and 2024, with strike rates of 165.53 and 157.53 respectively.

His performance during the competition won him praise from the likes of Wasim Akram and Misbah-ul-Haq, and saw him called up to Pakistan's limited-overs side for the tour to the West Indies.
