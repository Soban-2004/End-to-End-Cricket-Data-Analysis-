Rohit Sharma,"Languid and easy on the eye, Rohit Sharma owned all the shots in the book when he emerged from the Mumbai suburbs as heir apparent to the Indian batting greats of the 2000s. It took him time and persistence, but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20.",India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter
Virat Kohli,"India has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them.",India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Top order Batter
Rishabh Pant,"A match-turning, swashbuckling batter-keeper in the Adam Gilchrist mould, Rishabh Pant has had a starring role in more than a handful of India's biggest Test matches in his first few years in the team.",India,Left hand Bat,N/A,Wicketkeeper Batter
Suryakumar Yadav,"Hard-hitting 360-degree batter Suryakumar Yadav has all the shots, including a few not in any textbook save the one written by AB de Villiers. He also has a yen for making batting look easy, as he showed during four golden years with Mumbai Indians starting in 2018, during which they won the IPL title twice, thanks in no small part to his 1700-plus runs at a strike rate of around 140.",India,Right hand Bat,"Right arm Medium, Right arm Offbreak",Batter
Axar Patel,"Left-arm spinner Axar Patel has been increasingly handy with the bat in the lower order across formats - enough to be classified as a bowling allrounder. He played just one first-class game in his debut season for Gujarat, but had a more successful showing in 2013, when he was one of the key contributors to India Under-23s' title win in the ACC Emerging Teams Cup, with seven wickets, including a four-for in the semi-final against UAE. He was consistent for Gujarat with bat and ball in the Ranji Trophy that season, finishing with 369 runs at an average of 46.12 and 29 wickets at 23.58.",India,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder
Shivam Dube,"Within his first year of white-ball debut in domestic cricket, Dube had started hitting boundaries in the lower order and picking wickets. His Ranji Trophy debut also put him in the spotlight when he bagged a five-for to dismiss five of Karnataka's top six batters, combined with a brisk 71 down the order. But the headline moment came when he smashed five sixes in an over off Pravin Tambe in a Mumbai T20 league game and repeated the feat in a Ranji match against Baroda, just a day before the IPL auction in December 2018. That season, Dube had also taken a seven-for against Karnataka and struck his maiden first-class century. Those shot his value up so much that RCB splurged Rs 5 crore for him. However, he couldn't prove to be the finisher RCB wanted him to be for two seasons and he switched to Rajasthan Royals for the 2020 season.",India,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder

Reeza Hendricks,"Hendricks made his international debut in a T20I series against Australia in 2014, where he made 49 in the third match. In August 2018 he joined the short list of South Africans to have made a century in their first ODI, cracking 102 from 89 balls against Sri Lanka to seal an away series win.",South Africa,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Opening Batter
Quinton de Kock,"Quinton de Kock's fearless striking and handy glovework earned him comparisons to greats of the game like Adam Gilchrist and Mark Boucher early in his career. By 21, he shared the record for the most successive ODI centuries - three - before it was bettered by Kumar Sangakkara. A year later, he had established himself in all three formats for South Africa.",South Africa,Left hand Bat,N/A,Wicketkeeper Batter
Aiden Markram,"He did well against tougher opposition as well, making 94 in a comprehensive win over India in Centurion in January 2018 and two big hundreds against Australia in the contentious Sandpapergate series two months later. But overseas success took a while to come - after disappointing tours of India and Sri Lanka, Markram made his first away Test hundred in a second-innings effort in Rawalpindi in February 2021, showing he had the technique to navigate pitches that turned and stayed low. His 108 gave South Africa a fighting chance, but they eventually lost the series 2-0.",South Africa,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder
Tristan Stubbs,"Schooled at Grey High School in Gqeberha, Stubbs was the captain of the first team. He was also the leading run-scorer at the 2018 Khaya Majola Cricket week, an Under-19 tournament in South Africa, and was selected for the SA Schools side. Stubbs did not make the South Africa Under-19 squad, but was instead selected to make his provincial debut for Eastern Province in January 2020.",South Africa,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batter
Heinrich Klaasen,"Schooled at Menlopark High School and the University of Pretoria, Klaasen made his first-class debut for Northerns in the 2012-13 season and averaged 42.58 in the provincial three-day cup.

David Miller,"A hard-hitting left-hander with a penchant for clearing the boundary, David Miller made famous the phrase ""If it's in the arc, it's out the park."" Miller is a self-styled finisher who is strong off the front and back foot and eager to swing his arms, as well as a gun fielder.",South Africa,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter
Marco Jansen,"Jansen went on to tour India with South Africa's Under-19 side in 2019 and, that season, was the leading wicket-taker for North West in the three-day provincial competition. He travelled with South Africa's Test squad to Pakistan in early 2021 and was signed by Mumbai Indians for the IPL. Jansen made his Test debut against India in the Boxing Day Test in 2021, and became the first player born in the 2000s to be capped for the national side.Firdose Moonda",South Africa,Right hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Bowling Allrounder
Keshav Maharaj,"In his youth, Maharaj was a pace bowler, whose father played for Natal B during segregation years. He turned to spin on a whim in the nets one afternoon at school. He found that it worked and stuck to it. Maharaj's secret was his accuracy. At the Dolphins, he was able to combine that with an ability to take wickets at key moments.",South Africa,Right hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler
Kagiso Rabada,"A strapping, genuine quick who regularly bowls in the 140-150kph range, Kagiso Rabada is the most exciting talent to emerge from South Africa in the post No.1 Test ranking era. Before he had turned 21, Rabada had already established himself as a potential leader of the attack.",South Africa,Left hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler
Anrich Nortje,"With an ability to combine high speed with late swing, Nortje is the ideal successor to his hero Dale Steyn in South Africa's pace attack.",South Africa,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler
Tabraiz Shamsi,"Shamsi bounced between the Highveld and Kwa-Zulu Natal and pushed for a place at franchise level after a strong 2013-14 season for Easterns. He took 47 wickets at 20.02 to finish third in the three-day cup wicket-takers' list, and then played five matches in the 2014-15 franchise 20-over competition where caught the eye of the touring West Indians, who were visiting South Africa that summer.",South Africa,Right hand Bat,Left arm Wrist spin,Bowler
Arshdeep Singh,"Arshdeep is one of only three Indian bowlers, after Jhulan Goswami and Ajit Agarkar, to start his T20I career with a maiden over. A death-overs specialist known for his accurate yorkers and 140kph-plus deliveries, he made his international debut in England in 2022.",India,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Bowler
Jasprit Bumrah,"Jasprit Bumrah grabbed eyeballs first with his unorthodox action, and then his bowling skills. Armed with an anomalous, sling-arm action and natural pace, the peculiar release point of Bumrah's deliveries makes it hard for batsmen to pick him.",India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler
Kuldeep Yadav,"Kuldeep Yadav started as a fast bowler when he first joined a cricket academy in Kanpur, but was asked by his coach Kapil Pandey to switch to something much rarer - left-arm wristspin. The change wasn't smooth - Kuldeep admitted that he had even tried once - but he soon realised bowling left-arm wristspin was the way forward for him. And he was good at it too, having not only solid control over the length, but also a potent wrong'un among his variations.",India,Left hand Bat,Left arm Wrist spin,Bowler
Phil Salt,"Born in Wales but raised in Barbados, Salt's interests quickly switched from football to cricket. He had watched Manchester City home and away growing up, but the move to the Caribbean inspired a desire to play cricket, and play it aggressively. He won a scholarship to play cricket at Reed School in Surrey, from where he was recommended to Keith Medlycott and joined their academy. He made a first-team debut in August 2015, but it wasn't until 2018 that he really broke through.",England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter
Jos Buttler,"England have had many players down the ages who have gained world acclaim, but Jos Buttler is arguably their first global Twenty20 superstar. Buttler helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary as they turned a group-stage exit in the 2015 World Cup into a triumph on home soil four years later, with his efforts with the bat and the gloves crucial to their Super-Over victory in the final. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai. He has also shone at the IPL, and quickly became a senior player in the Test side since his surprise recall in 2018.",England,Right hand Bat,N/A,Wicketkeeper Batter
Moeen Ali,"While many critics dismissed him as a ""part-time"" bowler, Moeen had a record to compare with the best in county cricket over recent seasons. And while he suffered more than his share of ups and downs, for the next five years he manfully carried the load in one of the most under-resourced areas of the English game. When he was dropped during the 2019 Ashes, subsequently losing his central contract, it turned out to be the beginning of the end for Moeen as a Test allrounder; nevertheless, on calling time in 2021, he finished just shy of 3000 Test runs and 200 wickets, making him England's third most-prolific spinner of all time.",England,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder
Jonny Bairstow,"Jonny Bairstow, the son of the former England wicketkeeper David Bairstow, is a combative wicketkeeper-batter who has become a cricketer to be reckoned with in England's middle order. The journey was far from easy for Bairstow, especially with Jos Buttler in contention for the gloves, but prolific run-making for Yorkshire eventually made a case that England's selectors could not ignore. Galvanised by his selection, runs flowed.",England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter
Harry Brook,"By then, Brook was also a T20 World Cup winner, after featuring in England's triumph in Australia earlier in the winter, and at the IPL auction in December, he was snapped up by Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs 13.25 crore (£1.3 million).",England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batter
Sam Curran,"Perhaps the only real conclusion to that debate is it does not matter. Curran has developed into an X-factor cricketer of global repute. He was player of the T20 World Cup in 2022, taking 13 wickets at 11.38, with an economy rate of 6.52, emerging as a canny death bowler to take England to glory. He signed off with a player of the match performance in the final against Pakistan, taking 3 for 12.",England,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Allrounder
Liam Livingstone,"Livingstone first attracted attention when he creamed 350 in 138 balls for club side Nantwich in 2015 - one of the largest individual scores in any officially sanctioned limited-overs game.  He won a trophy that season when Lancashire took the NatWest Blast title, though he himself didn't do much of note (and needed stitches after he was attacked in a bar earlier during in the competition).",England,Right hand Bat,"Right arm Offbreak, Legbreak",Batting Allrounder
Chris Jordan,"Jordan's career looked to be going nowhere at the end of 2012 when he was released by Surrey, but he made his international debut less than a year later. He enjoyed a run in England's white-ball sides in the games following the 2013-14 Ashes tour, and was given a Test debut the following summer.",England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler
Jofra Archer,"A silky fast bowler and dangerous lower-order hitter from Barbados, Archer is capable of hair-raising speeds. He played for West Indies Under-19s in 2013, but soon declared his intention to play for England when he moved to the country, taking advantage of his British passport (thanks to his English father). He broke into Sussex's first-class side in 2016, when he made his debut in all three formats and took 35 wickets in all, 23 of them at 30 runs apiece in Division Two; he also struck 72 in his debut match from No. 8 against Essex. The following season fetched him a bumper crop of Championship wickets - 61 at a little over 25 each in Sussex's fourth-place finish on the table - and an average of over 45 with the bat.",England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler
Adil Rashid,"His success in the limited-overs game owed much to his variation - and his wicked googly in particular - and it was no great surprise when he got his Test debut in 2015 against Pakistan. Rashid took 60 wickets in 19 Tests, but often struggled for control and a long-standing shoulder complaint meant his focus returned to the shorter formats after the 2019 tour of the Caribbean.",England,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Bowler
Reece Topley,"That four years on Topley is regarded as a vital part of England's white ball plans, as a left-armer who deliveries from a great height, speaks of his mental fortitude. In 2022, he grew in both white ball codes at international level, registering the best ODI figures for an Englishman with 6 for 34 against India at Lord's. A sucker-punch came on the eve of that year's T20 World Cup when he rolled his left ankle, rupturing the ligaments, after stepping on a boundary sponge during a fielding drill ahead of England's final warm-up match. He was subsequently ruled out of the tournament.",England,Right hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler
Rahmanullah Gurbaz,"Fast behind the stumps and explosive in front of them, Rahmanullah Gurbaz had a fast ascent to becoming one of the first names on the Afghanistan team sheet.",Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter
Ibrahim Zadran,"Zadran, a veteran of two Under-19 World Cups in which he was his side's top run-scorer, got off to a storming start in senior international cricket: he made three hundreds in five ODIs when he came back to the format following a two-year hiatus after his first match, in 2019. The last of those centuries was 162 against Sri Lanka in Pallekele, which won him the Player-of-the-Series award.",Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Opening Batter
Gulbadin Naib,"But Naib was dropped soon after, and had to deal with hardship in his personal life: his father was unemployed, his mother had hepatitis, and the family was struggling to deal with the needs of his disabled sister. Happily, Naib was able to force his way back into the national team in 2011 and settled into a floating role in Afghanistan's middle order, chipping in with both bat and ball. His maiden international fifty contributed to Afghanistan's first T20I series win over a Full Member, against Zimbabwe in October 2015. A few months later, he scored his first ODI fifty in a series win against the same opposition, to help Afghanistan break into the top ten in the ODI rankings. His biggest test came when he was promoted to captain the side for the 2019 World Cup; unfortunately Afghanistan failed to win a single game in the tournament.",Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Batting Allrounder

Mohammad Nabi,"Nabi took up cricket at the age of 10 while living in Peshawar. Honing his skills with endless sessions of tennis-ball cricket, he managed to begin training at Arshad Khan's academy in Peshawar and made his competitive debut against Rahim Yar Khan Cricket Association in Pakistan's erstwhile Cornelius Trophy in 2003, making 61 after having just met most of his team-mates. On a tour of India he caught Mike Gatting's eye with a century against a visiting MCC side. That brought him more valuable experience with MCC, for whom he made his first-class debut, and he went on to play a major role in Afghanistan's progress to the World Cup Qualifiers in South Africa in 2009. Nabi struck 58 against Scotland on one-day international debut and 102 in his first first-class game for Afghanistan, against a Zimbabwe XI.",Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder

Rashid Khan,"Rashid Khan has been Afghanistan's first global superstar, and the key to their successes in their early years in international cricket.

Noor Ahmad,"After making his first-class debut in 2019 at the age of 14, Noor was only 15 when he landed a contract with Melbourne Renegades, making him the youngest player in BBL history. A Pakistan Super League gig with Karachi Kings followed in 2021, and then came a maiden call-up to the Afghanistan team. However, it was after he took 10 wickets in the 2022 Under-19 World Cup that Noor made his international debut in a T20I against Zimbabwe, and won the Player of the Match award for taking four wickets.",Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Left arm Wrist spin,Bowler

After working with Dwayne Bravo across franchises as well as during his stint as Afghanistan's fast-bowling consultant, Farooqi has developed his death-bowling skills to become a potent weapon.",Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler
Litton Das,"Perhaps the first wicketkeeper-batter in the country good enough to be seen as a long-term successor to Mushfiqur Rahim, he emerged from the northern district of Dinajpur, around 330km from the capital, Dhaka, beginning his adolescent life as a young cricketer at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protishtan and impressing with his heavy run-scoring in schools and age-group cricket. Litton was picked in Bangladesh's Under-19 side in 2012, the year after he made his first-class debut, and over two U-19 World Cups, that year and in 2014, he cumulatively averaged over 50, with a century and three fifties.",Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter
Tanzid Hasan,"Tanzid was Bangladesh's great hope in the World Cup in 2023, though he made just a single half-century, averaging 16.11 in the nine matches. He showed vulnerability driving through the off-side, particularly against high-quality fast bowling. Tanzid's only fifty was against India in Pune when he shelved his doubts, using his limited strokes to good effect. In his only ODI since the World Cup, he made a breezy 84 against Sri Lanka in Chattogram.",Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,N/A,Opening Batter
Najmul Hossain Shanto,"The turnaround in his form came at the 2022 T20 World Cup. He began the tournament uncertain of his place in the XI but finished it as his side's leading run-getter. The clarity in his mind and his shot-making was evident as he turned 2023 into a bumper year, becoming Bangladesh's top run-scorer in every format. He scored 1650 international runs at an average of 42.30 that year, versus 1603 runs at 22.90 between 2017 and 2023. Mostly a No. 3 batter, Shanto cemented his place in the ODI and Test sides in 2023, and also became the first Bangladesh batter to score over 500 runs in a BPL season.",Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter
Shakib Al Hasan,"In 2008, in his seventh Test, Shakib made 71 and took 7 for 36 in Chittagong against New Zealand, only the second instance of a Bangladesh bowler taking as many wickets in a Test innings. The next year, in his first Test as captain, against a weakened West Indies side in Grenada, Shakib took eight wickets and scored an unbeaten 96 in a tense but successful fourth-innings chase of 215, leading Bangladesh to their first overseas series victory. Three Tests later he scored 87 and 100 - his maiden Test century - in a losing cause against New Zealand in Hamilton.",Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder
Soumya Sarkar,"Like many top-level Bangladesh players, Soumya is an alumnus of the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protishtan (BKSP) in Dhaka.

Towhid Hridoy,"Hridoy plays with flowing strokeplay, particularly his aerial shots over the covers and his pulls and flicks with dazzling wrist work.

Mahmudullah,"He showed ability in different batting positions and, combined with his handiness with the ball, that made him invaluable to Bangladesh in the 2010s. He finished as Bangladesh's sixth-highest run-scorer in Tests when he abruptly retired from the format in 2021. Mahmudullah also captained Bangladesh, in T20Is predominantly. Whether captain or not, team-mates over the years lauded Mahmudullah for being a natural leader and a shrewd thinker about the game.",Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder
Rishad Hossain,"Rishad's ascent from a novelty act to a match-winner might not have come as a surprise to the outside world - legspinners are an essential part of bowling attacks in most cricket teams - but Bangladesh had been cynical about legspin for long. They have been so discouraging of that style of bowling that there are hardly any in domestic cricket too. Rishad, however, has changed perceptions since making his international debut in 2023.",Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Allrounder
Tanzim Hasan Sakib,"This was the first time also that Tanzim got a long run in the Bangladesh team. Since his debut in September 2023, he has never played more than two matches in a series or tournament. That's because of Bangladesh's impressive fast bowling stock in that period.",Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowling Allrounder

Mustafizur Rahman,"He made his first-class debut for Khulna in the 2013-14 season and, after taking eight wickets in the U-19 World Cup in the UAE, he was surprisingly picked for Bangladesh A's tour of West Indies. Returning from that short trip, he was viewed as a better bowler and slowly picked up more variations. He initially lacked pace but built it up through the 2014-15 first-class season, when he took 26 wickets at an average of 19.08.",Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler
David Warner,"After he was charged as the man who instructed team-mate Cameron Bancroft to use sandpaper on the ball in the infamous Cape Town Test, Warner, though not punished by the ICC, was banned from international and Australian domestic cricket by Cricket Australia for 12 months, stripped of the vice-captaincy, and banned from leadership roles for life.",Australia,Left hand Bat,Legbreak,Opening Batter
Travis Head,Head earned his first call-up to Australia's squad at the age of 22 for a series of T20Is against India in early 2016 and it was initially the white-ball game where he established himself before Test cricket took over following a debut in 2018.,Australia,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter
Mitchell Marsh,"Mitchell Marsh, one of the most well-known surnames in Australian cricket, had been an alluring prospect for many years but struggled to cement a place across formats.

Tim David,"Mumbai Indians' decision to sign Tim David for INR 8.25 crore (AUD 1.5 million) at the 2022 IPL auction confirmed two things. Firstly, that the game's formats had diverged so much that a man without a state contract or even a first-class appearance to his name could be worth such a sum; and secondly, that David had become one of the world's most sought-after T20 finishers over the previous 12 months.",Australia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter
Matthew Wade,"Wade was a talented junior footballer, but at 170cm decided he was too short to make a career out of it and pursued cricket instead. It wasn't plain sailing: that he played any international cricket at all is a credit to his mental toughness - at 16, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer, and required two cycles of chemotherapy to defeat the illness.",Australia,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter
Pat Cummins,"Earmarked as a potential star from a young age, Pat Cummins made his Test debut as an 18-year-old but had to wait six years for his next appearance as injuries struck a body that could not withstand the workload. The bowler who emerged in 2017 was a thoroughbred quick who became one of the standout players in the world and, in late 2021, Australia's Test captain in dramatic circumstances. By 2023 he had led the team to the World Test Championship and ODI World Cup.",Australia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler

Josh Hazlewood,"Although he was only 23 at the time, the baggy green had felt a long time coming, given that Hazlewood had been highly regarded for so long.  At 17, he had become the youngest fast bowler to be selected by New South Wales, and at 19 he was in his first one-day international against England at Southampton, joining Craig McDermott and Ray Bright as the only Australian 19-year-olds to play the format so soon. Hazlewood was initially chosen for Australia's Test tour of India in late 2010 but was withdrawn due to a back stress injury, and it was not until four years later that he finally played his first Test, having added significant strength to his 196cm frame.",Australia,Left hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler
Adam Zampa,"An energetic and competitive legspinner, Zampa emerged in Australia's limited-overs squads in 2016 after a successful summer for South Australia and the Melbourne Stars. He has subtle changes of pace and variations, including a wrong'un (a classic of which dismissed Kane Williamson at the SCG just days before the Covid lockdowns) and straight ball making up for a lack of prodigious turn. He's a colourful character off the field, but in contrast, his bowling, focusing on control, is clinical.",Australia,Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Bowler
Kyle Mayers,"He had won his place on the back of some impressive form in regional cricket for Barbados, making his maiden professional hundreds in 2019-20.

Shai Hope,"Hope was 23 at the time, the youngest member of the XI, leading West Indies to victory with scores of 147 and 118 not out. They had been faced with a target of 322 - not since Bradman's Invincibles rocketed to 404 for 3 in 1948 had a team chased that many on Yorkshire's storied turf, and won. Adding to the occasion was the fact West Indies had been dismantled only a week ago, England beating them by an innings and 209 runs to ensure their fans could savour the advent of day-night Test cricket in the country.",West Indies,Right hand Bat,N/A,Wicketkeeper Batter
Nicholas Pooran,"Nicholas Pooran confirmed his status as one of the most exciting young batting talents in the modern game with a sublime innings of 118 off 103 in West Indies' defeat to Sri Lanka at the 2019 World Cup, but only four years earlier the idea that he would play international cricket seemed fanciful.",West Indies,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter
Roston Chase,"Slotted in at No. 6 for West Indies' home series against India in 2016, Chase did not take long to show he belonged. In his second Test, at Sabina Park, he became only the fourth West Indian, after Denis Atkinson, Collie Smith and Garry Sobers, to take a five-wicket haul and score a hundred in a Test; he bowled more overs than anyone else in India's only innings to finish with 5 for 121, and batted through all of the fifth day to score an unbeaten 137 and lead his side to an improbable draw. He pulled off that feat again in 2017 against Pakistan in Roseau, where he made an unbeaten 101, exactly half of his team's total in the innings, but they failed to chase down a tough 304. The match before, he had made another hundred, this time in a West Indies win.",West Indies,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder

Rutherford played the next PSL for Peshawar Zalmi, and scored 276 runs at a strike rate of 153.

His 24 first-class wickets that season and the World Cup performance saw him fast-tracked into the Test side; he debuted against India at Gros Islet in August 2016 and bounced out Virat Kohli for 3 for his first wicket. His ODI debut came a few months later, against Pakistan in Sharjah.",West Indies,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler

He didn't set the stage alight, returning six wickets in six bowling innings at 34.83, but has built steadily since, as his numbers across formats show.

Harmeet led Mumbai at the U-16 and U-19 levels before making a spectacular first-class debut, when he grabbed a seven-wicket match haul in Mumbai's comfortable victory against Himachal Pradesh.

Though New Zealand had a poor tour of England in 2022, losing all three Tests, Mitchell came out of the summer glowing, with two fifties and three hundreds, including a massive one at Trent Bridge.

Auckland's pitches, which provide little aid to spin bowlers, and captains who have been traditionally ill equipped with knowledge of how to use slow bowlers, didn't help. Despite that, he became a force in the domestic first-class game. For Northern Districts in the seven Plunket Shield seasons starting in 2012-13, his mastery of turn and flight fetched him 181 wickets.

He also scored match-winning hundreds in Harare, and at home against West Indies and Pakistan, the latter two scores coming in the second innings, but more often than not, de Silva was playing with his back to the wall, in the midst of a collapse, like the hundred to save the Delhi Test in 2017 and 46 and 47 not out to help Sri Lanka survive longer in Christchurch in 2023. In the next Test in Wellington, he made 98 in the follow-on. What makes him even more valuable is his ability to chip in with part-time offspin and his reliable fielding in the slips.

While he struggled in the 2011 World Cup, he ended the tournament with 101 in Ireland's victory against the Netherlands, and a century in Ireland's ODI series against Pakistan in May 2011 had Waqar Younis purring. He added another against the same opponents in Ireland's tie with Pakistan two years later.

A lengthy lean patch followed, and once he lost his place to Sarfaraz for the World T20 in 2016, there was little doubt who Pakistan's No. 1 wicketkeeper was. After the debacle at the World T20, Sarfaraz was appointed captain of the limited-overs sides, and consequently Rizwan's game time diminished further, coming to a complete halt until Sarfaraz sat out the last five games on the tour to South Africa in January 2019 serving a ban.",Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter

Fakhar Zaman,"However, his prolific form earned him a contract in the PSL with the Lahore Qalandars. He showed flashes of the class he'd been displaying domestically, particularly during a 33-ball 56 against Karachi where he destroyed the opposition bowling and looked extremely elegant while doing so. It earned him a call-up to Pakistan's T20I side for the West Indies tour, and he made his debut in the second match in Port of Spain.",Pakistan,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Opening Batter

His ability with the U-19 side caught PSL franchise Islamabad United's eye, who gave the young leggie a chance he accepted with aplomb. His performance during the competition won him praise from the likes of Wasim Akram and Misbah-ul-Haq, and saw him called up to Pakistan's limited-overs side for the tour to the West Indies. His meteoric rise continued as he flourished in the first two T20Is, taking seven wickets for 21 runs and winning the Man-of-the-Match award on both occasions.",Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Allrounder

He pushed Shaheen to hard-ball cricket following years of the younger brother enjoying success in Pakistan's informal tape-ball circuit. In 2015, FATA selected him after an U-16 talent hunt programme.

However, he had to bide his time on the bench for nearly a year afterwards, until the ICC revised its eligibility guidelines for non-citizen residents in October 2017.

The ICC's guidelines at the time said only two players could be in the starting XI who were four-year residents but not yet seven-year residents of an adopted country, and so Bilal struggled to crack the regular Oman starting line-up over the course of 2016, but a breakout performance at the Desert T20 tournament in the UAE in January 2017 turned things around.

In November 2020 against West Indies, he scored a 46-ball T20I century, then the fastest for a New Zealander, and he finished 2021 with the most sixes in T20s that year. Batting primarily in the middle order, Phillips was instrumental in New Zealand's run to the 2021 T20 World Cup final, and played an unforgettable innings in the 2022 edition - a 64-ball 104 against Sri Lanka in a match in which the other 19 batters combined to score 149 runs off the bat.

Neesham began his first-class career with Auckland, but a move Otago worked well for him, as he made some important contributions in the 50-over format in the 2011-12 season, making three 40-plus scores in seven innings, all of them coming at more than a run a ball. He was among the wickets too, taking a career-best 5 for 44 against Wellington and 4 for 23 against Canterbury.

He is, however, a right-armer and by his own admission is a natural at getting the ball to swing into the right-hander.

Although he was a wicketkeeper-batter early in his domestic career, Bracewell adapted to being more of an offspin-bowling allrounder role for New Zealand, even taking a hat-trick in his second T20I, against Ireland.
